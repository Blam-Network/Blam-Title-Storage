New Intel has been deployed into Sunrise to get you up to speed on the new mission, updated game Support, and the ODST squad you'll be fighting alongside when you drop feet first into the city of New Mombassa. If you've already laid eyes on blam.network, then you're combat ready, but keep that link in your sights. There's more content inbound and coming in hot - classified material you haven't seen. And make sure to keep the Halo 3: ODST disc secure, this hardware also doubles as an invitation to the Halo 3 B.U.N.G.L.E. Championship in 2025."
